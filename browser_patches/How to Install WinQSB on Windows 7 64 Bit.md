## What is a Virtual Machine?
 
A virtual machine (VM) is a software that simulates a computer system within another computer system. It allows you to run different operating systems and applications on the same physical machine without affecting each other. For example, you can run Windows XP on a Windows 7 machine using a VM. This way, you can use older software that is not compatible with newer versions of Windows.
